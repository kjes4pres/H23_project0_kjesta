## Authors

### Comments
- Took me some time in the beginning to get used to github, especially with the .gitignore file. I think I have commited way more than needed to in the beginning. 

- To answer the last question in exercise 8: I did not have to alter the original division function in calculator.py to implement the test for ZeroDivisionError. 

 - Unsure about the format of my commit messages. Would love to get some feedback on those. Too short/long, detailed enough? etc. 

 - Did not have time to finish 9d.
